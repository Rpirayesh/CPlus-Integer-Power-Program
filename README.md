C++ BigInteger Power Program
Overview
Welcome to the BigInteger Power Program, an advanced C++ solution designed to handle large integer computations. This program elegantly demonstrates the power of object-oriented programming in handling complex numerical problems without relying on non-standard libraries.

Features
User Input: The program prompts the user to enter an integer ranging from 0 to 99999.
BigInteger Calculation:
Input Processing: Upon receiving the input (let's call it A), the program reverses its digits to create a new integer, B.
Power Computation: The program then calculates A raised to the power of B (i.e., A^B).
Result Output: It efficiently handles and outputs the result of this substantial calculation.
Constraints
The implementation adheres strictly to standard C++ libraries. Usage of external libraries like Boost or GMP is intentionally avoided to showcase the raw capability of native C++ in handling large numbers.
Example Usage
vbnet
Copy code
Enter a number (0-99999): 123
Result: 123^321 is 7236703380637167314910989414116377862881179265757165890601055839039587036379840174409528068615550773640492165707028496172182896059297790954263709889769722310262262856678765409132782545399159514020570141296136418873240893619789055369971583695156999980043195776921700674332102625751793276416466231948791496253330274136820721118949461532655279066772041128547416263676516890721192413497337430449960135376665858559941735703924836467756917247995469583487467791524582153744522107597865277798136080074161485280424274076931083994487111719562249702540362855712911132265966235754355353516703339043001506118520760359577737869472018617942120590873170710805078696371738906375721785723
